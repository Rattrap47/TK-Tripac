Install wine
  sudo apt install wine
Run the following to install the 32bit libraries:
  sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt update && sudo apt install wine32:i386

Error raised: wine: could not load kernel32.dll, status c0000135

Suggested fix: Create a new custom Wine prefix (optional): 
If you want to keep your old prefix, you can create a new, isolated one:

    mkdir -p ~/myapp/prefix
    export WINEPREFIX=$HOME/myapp/prefix
    export WINEARCH=win32 # or win64 if needed
    wineboot --init
